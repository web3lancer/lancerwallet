- Secure key management and encryption
- Intuitive UI/UX for sending, receiving, and swapping tokens
- Plugin-based architecture for easy extensibility
- Hardware wallet integration (Ledger, Trezor)

- NFT support and marketplace
- Open-source and privacy-focused
- Community-driven development

## Core Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design:** Plugin-based, microservice, event-driven, dependency injection
