# LancerWallet

LancerWallet is an open-source, modular, and extensible crypto wallet inspired by TrustWallet. Built for scalability, security, and developer experience, it combines Web3 functionality with robust Web2 infrastructure powered by Appwrite.

## 🔗 Integrations

- Core Integration: https://github.com/web3lancer/contracts_lancerwallet_core.git — Smart contracts and core DAO logic for web3lancer web3 wallet functionality

## Features
- Multi-chain support (EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, and more)
- Secure key management and encryption
- Intuitive UI/UX for sending, receiving, and swapping tokens
- Plugin-based architecture for easy extensibility
- Hardware wallet integration (Ledger, Trezor)
- DeFi protocol integrations (Uniswap, 1inch, DEX aggregator)
- NFT support and marketplace
- Open-source and privacy-focused
- Community-driven development

## Core Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design:** Plugin-based, microservice, event-driven, dependency injection
- **Extensibility:** Plugin API, extension marketplace, configuration-driven, theme system
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling, caching, database sharding, CDN integration

    🔥 Critical Success Factors
    🧬 Modular DNA: Plugin-first architecture means ANY future feature becomes a plugin
    🌐 Network Agnostic: Supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and blockchains not invented yet
    📦 JSON Flexibility: Metadata fields in every collection = zero breaking migrations
    🔐 Security First: Client-side encryption ready for quantum resistance
    📱 Local-First: Reduces vendor dependency, supports decentralization trends
