1. **Removed Auth Requirement**
   - Updated middleware to allow access to all pages without authentication
   - Auth is now completely optional - users can use wallet features without signing up

2. **Dual Storage Strategy**

4. **Robust Store Management**
   - Store now supports both authenticated and unauthenticated modes
   - `loadLocalWallets()` for localStorage access
   - `unlockWallets()` works for both modes
   - `backupWalletsToAppwrite()` for manual cloud backup

5. **Auto-Wallet Creation on Signup**
   - New users who sign up get an automatic wallet created and backed up
   - Mnemonic is saved to localStorage for backup purposes
